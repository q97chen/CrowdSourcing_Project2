# CrowdSourcing_Project2

I've included both WINDOWS version and MAC version of the game

There are some bugs with the game.. 
The camera still goes past the bottom portion of the map but not the other three boundaries.
The high score does not keep track/doesn't work so I just put a high score in place of it.
